					<h3>Who am I?</h3>
					<p class="about">
						Mostly known as serchpics on Instagram, Sergio (which is me) is a photographer currently living in Dublin, Ireland. 
						<br><br>With the World as my workplace, I pursue a wide variety of photography styles but center in as portraits, landscapes, cars and animals (wild life and pets).
						<br><br>My interest in this fine art started in the summer of 2018 and since then photography as been part of my life. Initially (and for a long time) it was one of my hobbies, but with time it has become more important to the point of doing some proffesional work. 
						<br><br>From portrait and car sessions to taking pictures of families and their pets, I am able to perform in a range of areas. Also, during my years as a photographer I've mastered the art of editing photos using Adobe Lightroom, and this service has also been hired in a number of ocassions.

						<h3>Prices</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="prices" id="prices1">
						<h2>Portraits (individual, couples, friends, family, etc)</h2>
						<p>This pictures will be taken in the "real world" during day/night time to have available different scenarios and backgrounds, props and apportunities to take better portraits. Also, this helps to create a more relaxed and friendly atmosphere, which is what I look for when working with my clients. You can bring as many props and outfits as you want and we will work together with whatever we have to get the best portraits possible.
						<br>
						<br>
						The price is 50€ for 50 minutes of actual photography and it also includes the careful selection and edition of the pictures with the proffesional software Lighroom. For starteres, you can decide to go for one session (50 min) and if you are enjoying it and want to keep going we can arrange it on the go (again, relaxed and flexible photoshoot remember?). The final pictures will be sent to you via email using WeTransfer before one week has gone by. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Disclaimer! Depending on where you want the session to be, extra cost may be added to the price, so <a href="#contact">message me</a> to clarify this or any other doubt.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="prices" id="prices2">
						<h2>Sports (individual)</h2>
						<p>If you play any type of sport and want to have pictures of yourself performing at whatever you are doing, I will take pictures of you during doing so. The base price is 60€ for one hour of pictures and it also includes the careful selection and edition of the pictures with the proffesional software Lighroom, but depending on the sport you are playing you may want more or less time, so message me to discuss this.
